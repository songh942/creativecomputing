    <br>I wandered lonely as a cloud </br>
    <br>That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</br>
    <br>When all at once I saw a crowd,</br>
    <br>A host, of golden daffodils;</br>
    <br>Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</br>
    <br>Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
    

<br>Continuous as the stars that shine</br>
<br>And twinkle on the milky way,</br>
<br>They stretched in never-ending line</br>
<br>Along the margin of a bay:</br>
<br>Ten thousand saw I at a glance,</br>
<br>Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

<br>The waves beside them danced, but they</br>
<br>Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;</br>
<br>A poet could not be but gay,</br>
<br>In such a jocund company!</br>
<br>I gazed—and gazed—but little thought</br>
<br>What wealth the show to me had brought:</br>

<br>
<br>
<br> 

<br>For oft, when on my couch I lie</br>
<br>In vacant or in pensive mood,</br>
<br>They flash upon that inward eye</br>
<br>Which is the bliss of solitude;</br>
<br>And then my heart with pleasure fills,</br>
<br>And dances with the daffodils.</br>
