   <a>I wandered lonely as a cloud</br> </a>
   That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</br>
   <a>When all at once I saw a crowd,</br></a>
    A host, of golden daffodils;</br>
  <a> Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</br> </a>
  Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</br>
    

ß
<a>Continuous as the stars that shine</br></a>
And twinkle on the milky way,</br>
<a>They stretched in never-ending line</br></a>
Along the margin of a bay:</br>
<a>Ten thousand saw I at a glance,</br></a>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</br>


<a>The waves beside them danced, but they</br></a>
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;</br>
<a>A poet could not be but gay,</br></a>
In such a jocund company!</br>
<a>I gazed—and gazed—but little thought</br></a>
What wealth the show to me had brought:</br>


<a>For oft, when on my couch I lie</br></a>
In vacant or in pensive mood,</br>
<a>They flash upon that inward eye</br></a>
Which is the bliss of solitude;</br>
<a>And then my heart with pleasure fills,</br></a>
And dances with the daffodils.</br>
