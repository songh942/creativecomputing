How does changing the typography of an iconic logotype such as Google, affect the way people think of the company, especially when drastic changes are being made?

<br>

I personally think that changing the typography of an iconic logotype such as Google affect the way people think of the company, especially when drastic changes are made. Is is impossible to identify the company's iconic logo when the logo has changed drastically? Imagine a world-famous company suddenly changed it's logo without any notification. I don't think people will notice/be able to find that company. I think logo of the company of the typography of an Iconic logotype of the company is the most important part of the company's identity. It is not a good idea to change the logo or the typography of an Iconic logotype because it is something people are going to remember the company by.
