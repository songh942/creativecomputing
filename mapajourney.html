    <h1>
        Map a Journey : Part 1

    </h1>

        I went to a famous bakery store, Yonah Schimmel Knish Bakery, <br>
        placed near the Sara D. Roosevelt Park. It's located at 137 <br>
        East Houson street in the Lower East Side, Manhattan, New York.<br>
         My friend and I had no classes on that day, so we decided to <br>
        have a brunch together. While searching for the brunch cafes,<br>
        I found the most famous bakery store in New York City. Jonah<br>
        Schimmel's Knish Bakery is known for a famous bakery and <br>
        restaurant in New York. We all seem to be agreed to go to that <br>
        bakery store for brunch. We arranged to meet at the New School<br>
         University Centre at 1 pm. I hurriedly got up and dressed <br>
         (I quickly washed my face and brushed my teeth). I tried <br>
         my best not to be late for the appointment. I arrived 5 minutes<br>
         early, so I waited for my friend at the meeting point <br>
        (The New School University Centre). I called an uber as soon <br>
        as my friend arrived. We wanted to take a walk to the bakery store,<br>
        but it was freezing cold that day. Therefore my friend and I took <br>
        an uber to go to the Yonah Schimmel Knish Bakery store. It took <br>
        approximately 20 minutes to get to the bakery store. All of a sudden,<br>
         the uber driver asked us "how did you guys find this bakery store? "<br>
        and he asked us another question. He asked  "What kind of knish <br>
        bread do you guys want to try?". We asked him to recommend the <br>
        most famous knishes from that bakery store. He told us that there<br>
        are different flavors of knishes. The most popular flavour of knishes <br>
        are potato, sweet potato, spinach, mixed vegetable, and mushroom.<br>
After hearing all the descriptions and all the flavors of knishes, <br>
I had a craving for something plain. Before we get off the uber, I quickly<br> 
searched for the pictures of the knishes bread. At that moment, I was so <br>
excited to try all the different flavoured knishes bread from the Yonah Schimmel<br>
 Knish Bakery store. After 20 minutes, we finally arrived at the destination. <br>
as we walked in, we smelled the smell of freshly baked bread. My friend and I<br>
ordered the knishes bread. We ordered two potato knish breads and one mixed<br>
vegetable knish bread. I've never tasted anything like the knish breads before. It<br>
was my first time trying the knish breads. The taste of the knish bread was a bit<br>
obvious. The potato knish bread tasted like a potato bread and the mixed vegetable<br>
bread tasted like a vegetable bread. I really liked the overall taste of the knish bread<br>
and the overall mood of the bakery store. The bakery store seemed a bit old and<br>
the store seemed like a shabby store. The bakery store was on the Lower East side<br>
of New York since 1890 from its original location on Houston street. Even though<br>
the bakery store wasn't as clean as I expected, I truly liked the atmosphere of the<br>
bakery store and I kind of felt the nostalgia. The old pictures were hung on the wall<br>
of the bakery store. Those pictures reminded me of a photo gallery or a photo<br>
exhibition. If you take a close look at the pictures, you will see pictures of a famous<br>
people and the picture of an old newspapers. My friend and I enjoyed the brunch<br>
very much and we enjoyed the time we spent together in the Yonah Schimmel<br>
Knish bakery store. If I get to eat brunch with my friend again, I'm going to take my<br>
friend to the bakery store once more and try the other flavors of knish breads.<br>
