<br>A lot of people believe that the two terms “web design” and “web development” have same meanings and work the same way. However, the two terms “web design” and “web development” really do have very different meanings. It is important to know the difference between these two terms because these two terms are the most common terms for the web industry and the world wide web of today is developed by the web designer and web developer. </br>
<br>
<br>A web designer is someone who creates content for the web. Web designers use the principles of design to create a site. Their main purpose of using the principles of design is to arrange the designs/layouts of the site. They usually work on developing the web usability and create sites that are easy to use/ easy to understand and visually appealing.</br> 
<br>
<br>A web developer is someone who develop and manage the World Wide Web applications, web server, web browser,etc. They design and develop basic website layout and advanced interactive website features. Web developers don’t focus on making something(websites/blogs) look visually appealing. Instead of creating visually appealing sites, they create simple/organized website. They create websites with clean code.</br>
