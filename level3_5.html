   I wandered lonely as a cloud</br>
   That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</br>
   When all at once I saw a crowd,</br>
    A host, of golden daffodils;</br>
   Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</br>
  Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</br>
    

ß
Continuous as the stars that shine</br>
And twinkle on the milky way,</br>
They stretched in never-ending line</br>
Along the margin of a bay:</br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,</br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</br>


The waves beside them danced, but they</br>
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;</br>
A poet could not be but gay,</br>
In such a jocund company!</br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought</br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:</br>


For oft, when on my couch I lie</br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,</br>
They flash upon that inward eye</br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;</br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,</br>
And dances with the daffodils.</br>
